to handle event like pressing power button and closing the lead,
but the actual process that sends to sleep is something else

https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Systemd I followed the instruction to allow hibernation into swapfile.
added resume to initramfs, added kernel parameter. anyway suspend to RAM
was supposed to work out of the box but instead it freazes.

# pm-utils
https://www.linuxsecrets.com/archlinux-wiki/wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Pm-utils
didn't work either. added stuff to /etc/pm/config.d/config
didn't help

# uswsusp
also didn't help

#notes
I edited /etc/systemd/logind.conf 
was all commented out, OI added ignore to try preventing it from
suspending

#solution so far that seems to work:
enable acpid, define pm-suspend as the action to do on lid/powe/sleep
events etc in the file /etc/acpid/handler.sh

diable systemd (systemctl) default actions by editing the file
/etc/systemd/login.conf, setting all the above events to ignore.

# not related to susped but to power management:
install tlp, enable tlp.service,
masked systemd-rfkill.service and systemd-rfkill.socket as recommended
by arch linux, remember to unmask if tlp causes problems.
-disabled acpid, uninstalled pm-utils which conflicts tlp, see if it
works
suspend didn't work without pm-utils so I reversed the above steps.

#update
installed also vbetool
#update
since kernel 4.19 systemctrl suspend seems to work fine. still need
to set suspend to disk correctly.

#update
added kernel parameter iommu=soft to fix xorg bug in 4.20
